when i first read about amazon echo show i thought the sound quality would be inferior to echo because of the small size which to me would be a deal breaker i read that the sound is actually superior to echo  it is compatible with most existing security cameras so i decided to buy one then best buy ran a strong promotion if you buy  so i caved and bought  i have a number of echos and  echo dots in the house i am completely blown away by echo show here is a brief summary of thoughts likes  substantially the best sound quality of any echo to date with stronger bass directional stereo dolby audio  focused sound field to the front you can rock out louder with less sound to the sides  back so you do not share your music to all as does the  the  far field microphones are more effective than echo  high resolution  screen is perfect for a desk or kitchen  song lyrics are great free optional setting to turn on lyrics  photos of the album cover  the band on all music are awesome   buttons on top mute  camera defeat with red on screen indicator volume up  volume down  excellent resolution with builtin camera  auto presence detector turns show screen on when you are detected  speak to alexa just as with echo or dot  show mutes the volume  shows what you asked on the screen with the music volume lowered in the background  ask the forecast  you get written  verbal forecast you also get a second screen showing the next  days including real feel a picture of the anticipated weather chance of rain etc  say alexa show me the front porch or any of the numerous security cameras  within  seconds there is a highly detailed live video with sound  video conference  i do not know anyone else with show yet so i cannot try this but call yourself  you can see the picture they will see to adjust your surroundings  uses the same power supply as amazon echo  sleek shape fits right in with contemporary surroundings see photo of show in the center of the desk with   monitors  ipad pro  the touch screen sensitivity is perfect  build quality is first rate  rubber feet protect any surface  are anti  slip  addictive more than any other device this is one you will want in the center of your desk as shown in my photo because once you add the video component you will wonder how you enjoyed music sports  just about everything without it  see your shopping list  see visual confirmation that the lights you ask alexa to turn on actually turned on dislikes none i would only offer one design option i would offer an optional amazon echo show wireless subwoofer for this beast that you could buy later it would work like the many soundbars that include a wireless sub that would allow show to not only rock out but to shake the walls at the same timei am seriously planning to sell some echos  dots to pick up a couple more shows they are great,"['first', 'read', 'amazon', 'echo', 'show', 'think', 'sound', 'quality', 'would', 'inferior', 'echo', 'small', 'size', 'would', 'deal', 'breaker',

if you are looking for something to help you keep more organized or keep you up to date with weather markets and the latest news the amazon echo show is what you are looking for honestly the product is top of the line technology and is easy to use as long you are patient and work with it and read the directions the size of it is truly perfect it honestly reminds me of the size of normal alarm clock that would have on a nightstand and with that it truly can serve that purpose it also has a touch screen and i feel it is very durable and can stand to last the sound quality is also superb with dual  speakers it has bluetooth capabilities as well but it only works with android samsung fire os ios device excluding mac products the echo show comes in two colors black and white the product has many different features and functions and they can accommodate pretty much anyone‚äôs needs the top feature is the alexa app which is an application in which you can call commands and ask it questions about most anything then i believe the music capabilities are truly amazing and how you can ask it to play almost any song or playlist whenever you want also you can tell it to volume up or down as well another new modernized technology it has is the capability to do hands free voice command smart home options a couple things that could be improved is sometimes that it does not fully hear your exact words and it will search for something you aren‚äôt expecting the other function it could have is it could have single voice recognition to only several voices so then you don‚äôt have the entire room trying to mess with it constantly the price is also fair as well for its creative capabilities it has so if you are trying to find some new technology to add to your home the echo show would be a great addition for you,"['look', 'something', 'help', 'keep', 'organize', 'keep', 'date', 'weather', 'market', 'late', 'news', 'amazon', 'echo', 'show', 'look', 'honestly', 'product', 'top', 'line', 'technology', 'easy', 'use', 'long', 'patient', 'work', 'read', 'direction', 'size', 'truly', 'perfect', 'honestly', 'remind', 'size', 'normal', 'alarm', 'clock', 'would', 'nightstand', 'truly', 'serve', 'purpose', 'also', 'touch', 'screen', 'feel', 'durable', 'stand', 'last', 'sound', 'quality', 'also', 'superb', 'dual', 'speaker', 'bluetooth', 'capability', 'well', 'work', 'android', 'samsung', 'fire', 'o', 'ios', 'device', 'exclude', 'mac', 'product', 'echo', 'show', 'come', 'two', 'color', 'black', 'white', 'product', 'many', 'different', 'feature', 'function', 'accommodate', 'pretty', 'much', 'anyone‚äôs', 'need', 'top', 'feature', 'alexa', 'app', 'application', 'call', 'command', 'ask', 'question', 'anything', 'believe', 'music', 'capability', 'truly', 'amaze', 'ask', 'play', 'almost', 'song', 'playlist', 'whenever', 'want', 'also', 'tell', 'volume', 'well', 'another', 'new', 'modernize', 'technology', 'capability', 'hand', 'free', 'voice', 'command', 'smart', 'home', 'option', 'couple', 'thing', 'could', 'improve', 'sometimes', 'fully', 'hear', 'exact', 'word', 'search', 'something', 'aren‚äôt', 'expect', 'function', 'could', 'could', 'single', 'voice', 'recognition', 'several', 'voice', 'don‚äôt', 'entire', 'room', 'try', 'mess', 'constantly', 'price', 'also', 'fair', 'well', 'creative', 'capability', 'try', 'find', 'new', 'technology', 'add', 'home', 'echo', 'show', 'would', 'great', 'addition']",Positive

the alexa show was purchased to replace another much older device and while the show is a good device it is lacking in some aspects that i had in the older device im not sure if im missing it in the show but i was able to get internet cameras on the older device such as san diego zoo elephants that you cant get on the show while certainly not a deal breaker it was fun to watch setup was pretty straight forward and easy it is a good aspect that we can talk to the device and it knows what we want to a certain extent it is very literal at times and you have to make sure you have the exact code words or you get something other than what you want such as play or start or open i use it as an alarm clock and it is quite easy to set up the same time for my week but it would be a little more difficult if you have to work one weekend day of the week and then  more or other combination you would have to set up several different alarms one for each day as far as i can see some of the alarm sound choices are a bit alarming i dont really want to be terrified awake each day i found one that was mellow and at a moderate sound level works well it would be nice to be able to add your own alarm sounds so you could have it customized to what youd like i dont see that yet anywhere another thing about the alarm is if you try to dismiss it and touch the screen the wrong way it puts the alarm into snooze mode instead of turning it off if you tell it to dismiss the alarm it works fine but there are times id rather not say anything at that time of day and just dismiss it with a swipe which is possible but very sensitive and if you miss here comes snooze just little things that may get fixed in the future with enough feedback from the customers but some may not effect people as much as some people who have more impact with a particular anomaly i am thinking of getting a thermostat that hooks to it so i can monitor and change the heat and cooling but that is in the future at this time hoping that works well when it arrivesit will be nice to raise the temp a degree in the cold of winter without having to get out of the warmth of the bed all in all id say its a good emerging technology but needs a little work considering this type of thing was science fiction not too long ago its kind of where were heading,"['alexa', 'show', 'purchase', 'replace', 'another', 'much', 'old', 'device', 'show', 'good', 'device', 'lack', 'aspect', 'old', 'device', 'im', 'sure', 'im', 'miss', 'show', 'able', 'get', 'internet', 'camera', 'old', 'device', 'san', 'diego', 'zoo', 'elephant', 'cant', 'get', 'show', 'certainly', 'deal', 'breaker', 'fun', 'watch', 'setup', 'pretty', 'straight', 'forward', 'easy', 'good', 'aspect', 'talk', 'device', 'know', 'want', 'certain', 'extent', 'literal', 'time', 'make', 'sure', 'exact', 'code', 'word', 'get', 'something', 'want', 'play', 'start', 'open', 'use', 'alarm', 'clock', 'quite', 'easy', 'set', 'time', 'week', 'would', 'little', 'difficult', 'work', 'one', 'weekend', 'day', 'week', 'combination', 'would', 'set', 'several', 'different', 'alarm', 'one', 'day', 'far', 'see', 'alarm', 'sound', 'choice', 'bite', 'alarm', 'dont', 'really', 'want', 'terrified', 'awake', 'day', 'find', 'one', 'mellow', 'moderate', 'sound', 'level', 'work', 'well', 'would', 'nice', 'able', 'add', 'alarm', 'sound', 'could', 'customize', 'youd', 'like', 'dont', 'see', 'yet', 'anywhere', 'another', 'thing', 'alarm', 'try', 'dismiss', 'touch', 'screen', 'wrong', 'way', 'put', 'alarm', 'snooze', 'mode', 'instead', 'turn', 'tell', 'dismiss', 'alarm', 'work', 'fine', 'time', 'id', 'rather', 'say', 'anything', 'time', 'day', 'dismiss', 'swipe', 'possible', 'sensitive', 'miss', 'come', 'snooze', 'little', 'thing', 'may', 'get', 'fixed', 'future', 'enough', 'feedback', 'customer', 'may', 'effect', 'people', 'much', 'people', 'impact', 'particular', 'anomaly', 'think', 'get', 'thermostat', 'hook', 'monitor', 'change', 'heat', 'cool', 'future', 'time', 'hop', 'work', 'well', 'arrivesit', 'nice', 'raise', 'temp', 'degree', 'cold', 'winter', 'without', 'get', 'warmth', 'bed', 'id', 'say', 'good', 'emerge', 'technology', 'need', 'little', 'work', 'consider', 'type', 'thing', 'science', 'fiction', 'long', 'ago', 'kind', 'heading']",Positive
alexa show is really well put together the main reason for my purchase was to create my own surveillance system linking my ring doorbell and ring floodlights to view on command by alexa on the show screen yes you can talk to it and get results for almost any query but with the show you get a lot more the touch screen is great for video calls especially when you install the alexa app on your family cell phones alexa can scan items via upc and order them on amazon or tell you where to get them the recipes you ask for are not only spoken to you but shown to you also when music plays you can see the lyrics on screen if you use amazon music to play the music you can ask for a news briefing and you see the news highlights etc the speakers arent quite up to the same standard as the echo series but its close the sound fills the room nicely when the echo show is not being immediately used the screen shows a picture of your choice making it a digital frame too overall the device is very nice and they are constantly releasing new skills for alexa to use so it seems like there is always something new to wow you turning on and off lights adjusting your thermostat playing music viewing security cameras are all just the standard duties there is way more to do with this device,"['alexa', 'show', 'really', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'main', 'reason', 'purchase', 'create', 'surveillance', 'system', 'link', 'ring', 'doorbell', 'ring', 'floodlight', 'view', 'command', 'alexa', 'show', 'screen', 'yes', 'talk', 'get', 'result', 'almost', 'query', 'show', 'get', 'lot', 'touch', 'screen', 'great', 'video', 'call', 'especially', 'install', 'alexa', 'app', 'family', 'cell', 'phone', 'alexa', 'scan', 'item', 'via', 'upc', 'order', 'amazon', 'tell', 'get', 'recipe', 'ask', 'speak', 'show', 'also', 'music', 'play', 'see', 'lyric', 'screen', 'use', 'amazon', 'music', 'play', 'music', 'ask', 'news', 'brief', 'see', 'news', 'highlight', 'etc', 'speaker', 'arent', 'quite', 'standard', 'echo', 'series', 'close', 'sound', 'fill', 'room', 'nicely', 'echo', 'show', 'immediately', 'use', 'screen', 'show', 'picture', 'choice', 'make', 'digital', 'frame', 'overall', 'device', 'nice', 'constantly', 'release', 'new', 'skill', 'alexa', 'use', 'seem', 'like', 'always', 'something', 'new', 'wow', 'turn', 'light', 'adjust', 'thermostat', 'play', 'music', 'view', 'security', 'camera', 'standard', 'duty', 'way', 'device']",Positive

so we added this to our echo family of devices its nice to have screen but i honestly dont find i use it as much as i thought i would the video calling feature would be pretty great if we knew more people with a video capable echo device also weve had some technical issues that i havent been able to resolve as of yet ultimately this is a powerful little gadget and can be fun to pop on a movie while sitting at the kitchen bar counter its also awesome to be able to display our security camera feed for the outdoor cameras but you should probably investigate its features and your needs before splurging on this over one of the more traditional echo devices its essentially an alexa enabled tablet with a nice speaker so something to think about,"['add', 'echo', 'family', 'device', 'nice', 'screen', 'honestly', 'dont', 'find', 'use', 'much', 'thought', 'would', 'video', 'call', 'feature', 'would', 'pretty', 'great', 'knew', 'people', 'video', 'capable', 'echo', 'device', 'also', 'weve', 'technical', 'issue', 'havent', 'able', 'resolve', 'yet', 'ultimately', 'powerful', 'little', 'gadget', 'fun', 'pop', 'movie', 'sit', 'kitchen', 'bar', 'counter', 'also', 'awesome', 'able', 'display', 'security', 'camera', 'feed', 'outdoor', 'camera', 'probably', 'investigate', 'feature', 'need', 'splurge', 'one', 'traditional', 'echo', 'device', 'essentially', 'alexa', 'enabled', 'tablet', 'nice', 'speaker', 'something', 'think']",Positive

alexa show is really well put together the main reason for my purchase was to create my own surveillance system linking my ring doorbell and ring floodlights to view on command by alexa on the show screen yes you can talk to it and get results for almost any query but with the show you get a lot more the touch screen is great for video calls especially when you install the alexa app on your family cell phones alexa can scan items via upc and order them on amazon or tell you where to get them the recipes you ask for are not only spoken to you but shown to you also when music plays you can see the lyrics on screen if you use amazon music to play the music you can ask for a news briefing and you see the news highlights etc the speakers arent quite up to the same standard as the echo series but its close the sound fills the room nicely when the echo show is not being immediately used the screen shows a picture of your choice making it a digital frame too overall the device is very nice and they are constantly releasing new skills for alexa to use so it seems like there is always something new to wow you turning on and off lights adjusting your thermostat playing music viewing security cameras are all just the standard duties there is way more to do with this device,"['alexa', 'show', 'really', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'main', 'reason', 'purchase', 'create', 'surveillance', 'system', 'link', 'ring', 'doorbell', 'ring', 'floodlight', 'view', 'command', 'alexa', 'show', 'screen', 'yes', 'talk', 'get', 'result', 'almost', 'query', 'show', 'get', 'lot', 'touch', 'screen', 'great', 'video', 'call', 'especially', 'install', 'alexa', 'app', 'family', 'cell', 'phone', 'alexa', 'scan', 'item', 'via', 'upc', 'order', 'amazon', 'tell', 'get', 'recipe', 'ask', 'speak', 'show', 'also', 'music', 'play', 'see', 'lyric', 'screen', 'use', 'amazon', 'music', 'play', 'music', 'ask', 'news', 'brief', 'see', 'news', 'highlight', 'etc', 'speaker', 'arent', 'quite', 'standard', 'echo', 'series', 'close', 'sound', 'fill', 'room', 'nicely', 'echo', 'show', 'immediately', 'use', 'screen', 'show', 'picture', 'choice', 'make', 'digital', 'frame', 'overall', 'device', 'nice', 'constantly', 'release', 'new', 'skill', 'alexa', 'use', 'seem', 'like', 'always', 'something', 'new', 'wow', 'turn', 'light', 'adjust', 'thermostat', 'play', 'music', 'view', 'security', 'camera', 'standard', 'duty', 'way', 'device']",Positive

ive had lots of tablets in the past mostly from the samsung line but this is my first amazon fire so i want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these at the time that this was written alexa had not been added to the tabletfirst while this device runs an android type of operating system amazon puts its own spin on the operating system i dont feel like im using android this feels different to me it doesnt have the same level of customization that android users have come to appreciate that being said if you are an amazon prime member this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine its simply a fun way to consume your magazines books etcthere are  onscreen buttons on the bottom of the device the middle button immediately takes you to your home screen the button to the left acts as a sort of back button it also lets me get rid of my keyboard when i dont need it on screen but its open the button to the right is super important it took me a couple of days to realize what it does that square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open it lets you switch between apps but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out you can close them by pressing the x button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right if you leave all of those apps open and you never close them youll drain your battery make sure you use that little square button to clear your appsthe device has several menus that you swipe left to view first you start with your home screen you literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet all of your apps are housed here you swipe up to view all of them the tablet comes with several apps preinstalled such as slik amazons own internet browser audible good reads the amazon app store a weather app etc you can go to the amazon app store to download other apps such as twitter facebook etc you can combine the apps on this page into folders you just drag one app to another app and a folder appears this made my home screen much more manageable you can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings this feature doesnt necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps however i believe it only changes the font on your main screensif you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device when you have a new issues it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of new items the device comes with a free  month subscription to the washington post youll see that under new items when you initially activate your tabletyou can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos you can do this through the settings menu on the device if you want to use one of your own photos however you need to either take it on the device or move it into amazons photos app which is a cloudbased appso far i havent found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper im not crazy about the amazon photo app i found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into amazons cloud just so i could view them on my tablet that being said im not planning to take photos on this device i just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaperbeyond the home screen you can swipe to the right to view your other screen they are prearranged to be books videos games shop apps music audiobooks and newstand all of those screens are connected to your amazon account for example if you have kindle books youve already purchased they automatically will appear under the books menu your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu there doesnt seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages that bugs me but its not the end of the world theres also one menu to the left of the home menu its the recent page it shows you what youve received looked at on the tablet i never use it but it might be handy for some peopleone of my favorite features of this tablet is amazons on deck capability if youre an amazon prime member amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like the items dont count against your preinstalled memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full you can turn off the on deck feature if you dont like it ive been content with the video playback capability this isnt my major use of the device but the images look fine and the audio is ok ill talk more about the speakers later my other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the newstand ive tried  magazines on here and they all look gorgeous now i can always have my magazines with me so if im stuck at the airport or at the doctors office i always have them one of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free i just had to connect my account to the device this allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as ive had an account my other magazine didnt include a digital edition so i canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version it was an inexpensive magazine anyway there are several magazines that you can try free for  days on the device i did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasurethe kindle fire doesnt come with the google play store installed you can side load it to the device without rooting it and breaking your warranty you can google to find the instructions to do this its not difficult to do if youre fairly comfortable with technology it probably took me  minutes most of the apps i wanted were in the amazon store but there were a handful that i had paid for through google play the only way i could have them was to go back to access that store they have worked fine so far i despise the keyboard that amazon preinstalled on this device there are no lines between the letters on the keyboard i suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys but i hate it i fixed that problem by going to google play and downloading a new keyboard it was a pretty easy problem to solve so i cant complainapps that are connecting to the internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets but that generally doesnt bother me if you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop however that might drive you crazy the screen on this device isnt bad if i compare it to my fancy phone its not as shape but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone the screen is outstandingthe speakers are ok there are two of them located on the bottom of the screen i wont say that they are fantastic they arent in my opinion they are fine for watching youtube or a television show they are not ok for listening to music if you are an audiophile you can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the preinstall app but still your music will sound tinny that being said you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker use a pair of headphones etcthis device wasnt made for taking pictures it has a front and back camera but they arent designed to be spectacular im not using themi find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands i think thats partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick also i do have some hand problems similar to someone who has carpal tunnel syndrome i think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives im still waiting for it im greatly enjoying this device its simply fun to use the tablet there are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck particularly if you regularly use amazon services if you dont typically use amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the internet and youre looking for a low price tag this device may be ok for you,"['ive', 'lot', 'tablet', 'past',

full disclosure i own five amazon echos including a few dots as well as this tap so obviously im a fan of echoes honestly i couldnt figure out from amazons marketing and the online review how the tap fit in as compared to full blown echo and the dot i kept thinking it was limited compared to the echo and the dot because you had to tap the button to ask it question however given that its completely portable and runs for up to six hours on a charge it makes sense that it would wast battery if it was always listening for a voice command imo the tap sounds just as good and maybe even better the the echo in a much smaller form factor since its portable its probably going to be sitting next to you any way so tapping to ask a question is not really an issue and in someways is better when you have a full table as you can control who gets to request music my friends and i get into fun wars asking for different music on the full blown echo but it can also get a little annoying when someone plays michael bolton over my bruce springsteen bottom line just as good of sound as the full blown tap in a portable and smaller form very happy with all my echoes but this may be my favorite,"['full', 'disclosure', 'five', 'amazon', 'echo', 'include', 'dot', 'well', 'tap', 'obviously', 'im', 'fan', 'echo', 'honestly', 'couldnt', 'figure', 'amazon', 'market', 'online', 'review', 'tap', 'fit', 'compare', 'full', 'blown', 'echo', 'dot', 'keep', 'think', 'limited', 'compare', 'echo', 'dot', 'tap', 'button', 'ask', 'question', 'however', 'give', 'completely', 'portable', 'run', 'six', 'hour', 'charge', 'make', 'sense', 'would', 'wast', 'battery', 'always', 'listen', 'voice', 'command', 'imo', 'tap', 'sound', 'good', 'maybe', 'even', 'well', 'echo', 'much', 'small', 'form', 'factor', 'since', 'portable', 'probably', 'go', 'sit', 'next', 'way', 'tap', 'ask', 'question', 'really', 'issue', 'someways', 'well', 'full', 'table', 'control', 'get', 'request', 'music', 'friend', 'get', 'fun', 'war', 'ask', 'different', 'music', 'full', 'blown', 'echo', 'also', 'get', 'little', 'annoy', 'someone', 'play', 'michael', 'bolton', 'bruce', 'springsteen', 'bottom', 'line', 'good', 'sound', 'full', 'blown', 'tap', 'portable', 'small', 'form', 'happy', 'echo', 'may', 'favorite']",Positive

i bought this after i bought the amazon echo this was actually an impulse buy i saw it and bought it not reading any reviews on it because i enjoyed the echo so much it does everything the echo does but the sound quality is not great when youre playing at middle volume its ok the lows are there but doesnt sound good im guessing im comparing it with the bose mini soundlink when you set the volume high the bass is almost nonexistent the mids and highs are loud with the louder volume another difference is that with tap you have to press the mic button to start saying commands where as with the echo you can just say the wake up word and it will start listening to your commands i do like the fact that its portable because of that im on edge of returning it and holding off until maybe another model comes out with better bass,"['buy', 'bought', 'amazon', 'echo', 'actually', 'impulse', 'buy', 'saw', 'bought', 'reading', 'review', 'enjoy', 'echo', 'much', 'everything', 'echo', 'sound', 'quality', 'great', 'youre', 'play', 'middle', 'volume', 'ok', 'low', 'doesnt', 'sound', 'good', 'im', 'guess', 'im', 'compare', 'bose', 'mini', 'soundlink', 'set', 'volume', 'high', 'bass', 'almost', 'nonexistent', 'mids', 'high', 'loud', 'louder', 'volume', 'another', 'difference', 'tap', 'press', 'mic', 'button', 'start', 'say', 'command', 'echo', 'say', 'wake', 'word', 'start', 'listen', 'command', 'like', 'fact', 'portable', 'im', 'edge', 'return', 'hold', 'maybe', 'another', 'model', 'come', 'well', 'bass']",Positive

even when i‚äôm outside in bright sunlight the words of the book i‚äôm reading are still crystal clear that alone makes the kindle oasis worth what it cost methe kindle oasis wakes up in just seconds and any book i choose instantly opens ready to be readit is the perfect size and isn‚äôt heavy or bulky i really do read for hours at a time sometimes i pace the floor while i read sometimes i‚äôm on my elliptical machine when i read and sometimes i‚äôm sitting down no matter what i‚äôm doing the kindle oasis remains comfortable to hold and it is always easy on my eyeswhen i receive a book that is in pdf most of the time i can enlarge the words if it won‚äôt allow me to enlarge the words i can change the orientation of the page and the words are automatically larger i am able to make notes on the book if needed and i can highlight words andor passagesmy merlot leather cover is attractive when i flip it open it is just like opening the cover of a bookhow to make the battery laston the kindle oasis page it says that its ‚äúdualbattery charging system delivers months of battery life‚äù this was a huge thing for me instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day i would be able to read for months without charging the kindleis this how my oasis has performed well not so much there are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your oasis to last for two monthsfirst you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day that one is impossible for me there are days that i am only able to read for thirty minutes but they don‚äôt occur very often my kindle goes everywhere with me and i use just about every spare moment to readsecond the wireless needs to be turned off that one is easy to do but not always easy to remember the only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more booksthird this is based on your light setting at  that is way too low for me i keep my light setting anywhere from  to  don‚äôt limit my reading to thirty minutes a day and i try to remember to keep my wireless turned off my light setting is kept anywhere from  to  and i put my kindle to sleep the second i‚äôm done reading so how long does a single charge last me ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far but it would have kept a charge for several more days if i had remembered to turn my wireless off once i succeed in keeping my wireless off i will let you know how long the charge lastsnow i don‚äôt plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low i allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover i allow it to drain down to about  before i plug the cover and kindle into my computer to chargethe one thing that surprised me was that everything on the oasis is in black and white for some reason i thought that maybe the book covers would appear in color but since i bought the oasis to read books on color isn‚äôt neededspecial offers do appear on my screen but only when my kindle is going to sleep or waking up they aren‚äôt a distraction and to be honest they are kind of fun to look at you can pay a higher price so they won‚äôt appear on your kindle if you would rather not see themi asked myself some questions once i had my kindle and knew just how it worked if i had known before i bought my kindle

when they first announced the kindle oasis i did not have much of a desire to upgrade from my  generation kindle paperwhite just as i felt when they announced the voyagei read a lot so my kindle travels with me throughout the day most of the time i have never had an issue with battery life i have only had it get really low a few times typically when i was traveling so again i originally did not see a lot of the value to the oasisas the reviews for the oasis came out i started to realize what i did not like about my paperwhite and i began to have an interest in upgrading my paperwhite to the either the oasis or possibly the voyage the main thing i noticed is that i took my paperwhite out of the amazon case quite a lot especially when i was in a seated position this slight reduction in weight made it much more comfortable to hold for longer reading sessions i had some other minor issues with my paperwhite like when reading in the dark i couldnt find an adjustment for the light that i preferred  was a little too dim and  was a brighter than i needed i decided to pass on the voyage because i really did not like the case options and the pressure sensitive page turn optionnow that i have the oasis i definitely think it was worth it for me i really appreciate the reduced weight when the cover is off not to mention the ease of removing the cover compared to the paperwhite it provides the same reading experience although i did get a resolution upgrade compared to my older paperwhite which is a plusthe oasis is really comfortable in my hand which helps me forget that it is there when i was holding my paperwhite with my left hand at times i would accidentally go back a page which drove me crazy even though its just a minor inconveniencei have the black model because it was the only option available unless i was willing to wait a few more months the build quality of the oasis and its case is very nice just like with the paperwhite and the amazon leather case for it the only concern i have is how well it will protect the kindle i will update the review if i find this to be a problemi loved my paperwhite and i will recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade from an older kindle or buying one for the first time it definitely is great and the better buy but i am glad i decided to order the oasis the reduced weight ergonomic design and page turn buttons make it worth the added cost,"['first', 'announce', 'kindle', 'oasis', 'much', 'desire', 'upgrade', 'generation', 'kindle', 'paperwhite', 'felt', 'announce', 'voyagei', 'read', 'lot', 'kindle', 'travel', 'throughout', 'day', 'time', 'never', 'issue', 'battery', 'life', 'get', 'really', 'low', 'time', 'typically', 'travel', 'originally', 'see', 'lot', 'value', 'oasisas', 'review', 'oasis', 'come', 'start', 'realize', 'like', 'paperwhite', 'begin', 'interest', 'upgrade', 'paperwhite', 'either', 'oasis', 'possibly', 'voyage', 'main', 'thing', 'notice', 'take', 'paperwhite', 'amazon', 'case', 'quite', 'lot', 'especially', 'seat', 'position', 'slight', 'reduction', 'weight', 'make', 'much', 'comfortable', 'hold', 'longer', 'reading', 'session', 'minor', 'issue', 'paperwhite', 'like', 'read', 'dark', 'couldnt', 'find', 'adjustment', 'light', 'prefer', 'little', 'dim', 'brighter', 'need', 'decide', 'pass', 'voyage', 'really', 'like', 'case', 'option', 'pressure', 'sensitive', 'page', 'turn', 'optionnow', 'oasis', 'definitely', 'think', 'worth', 'really', 'appreciate', 'reduce', 'weight', 'cover', 'mention', 'ease', 'remove', 'cover', 'compare', 'paperwhite', 'provide', 'read', 'experience', 'although', 'get', 'resolution', 'upgrade', 'compare', 'old', 'paperwhite', 'plusthe', 'oasis', 'really', 'comfortable', 'hand', 'help', 'forget', 'hold', 'paperwhite', 'left', 'hand', 'time', 'would', 'accidentally', 'go', 'back', 'page', 'drive', 'crazy', 'even', 'though', 'minor', 'inconveniencei', 'black', 'model', 'option', 'available', 'unless', 'willing', 'wait', 'month', 'build', 'quality', 'oasis', 'case', 'nice', 'like', 'paperwhite', 'amazon', 'leather', 'case', 'concern', 'well', 'protect', 'kindle', 'update', 'review', 'find', 'problemi', 'love', 'paperwhite', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'look', 'upgrade', 'older', 'kindle', 'buy', 'one', 'first', 'time', 'definitely', 'great', 'well', 'buy', 'glad', 'decided', 'order', 'oasis', 'reduce', 'weight', 'ergonomic', 'design', 'page', 'turn', 'button', 'make', 'worth', 'add', 'cost']",Positive

i have had every kindle since the first and this is by far the best the screen was already great on the voyage but the front light on this screen is more white and more evenly distributed physical page turn buttons are so much better than none or the haptic feedback type they didnt include the automatically adaptive front light for some reason but i dont think ill miss it much as i was always wont to fiddle with it on the voyage anywaybut this device made me smile as soon as i held it for the first time because it has a larger bezel that you can really grip comfortably without touching the screen maybe this isnt a big deal for most but that is exactly why i spent the money to get this devicethe other thing i was hoping for was the ability to use the upper page turn button to go forward and this device does that and even better because it is software configurablethe cover is very small and light and doesnt add much bulk like the voyage origami case does the only downside is that it doesnt work as a hands free stand for readingi still wish it was waterproof,"['every', 'kindle', 'since', 'first', 'far', 'best', 'screen', 'already', 'great', 'voyage', 'front', 'light', 'screen', 'white', 'evenly', 'distributed', 'physical', 'page', 'turn', 'button', 'much', 'good', 'none', 'haptic', 'feedback', 'type', 'didnt', 'include', 'automatically', 'adaptive', 'front', 'light', 'reason', 'dont', 'think', 'ill', 'miss', 'much', 'always', 'wont', 'fiddle', 'voyage', 'anywaybut', 'device', 'make', 'smile', 'soon', 'hold', 'first', 'time', 'large', 'bezel', 'really', 'grip', 'comfortably', 'without', 'touch', 'screen', 'maybe', 'isnt', 'big', 'deal', 'exactly', 'spend', 'money', 'get', 'devicethe', 'thing', 'hop', 'ability', 'use', 'upper', 'page', 'turn', 'button', 'go', 'forward', 'device', 'even', 'well', 'software', 'configurablethe', 'cover', 'small', 'light', 'doesnt', 'add', 'much', 'bulk', 'like', 'voyage', 'origami', 'case', 'downside', 'doesnt', 'work', 'hand', 'free', 'stand', 'readingi', 'still', 'wish', 'waterproof']",Positive

its a great ereader but a little pricy it has the same specs as the voyage as far as pixels and procesor which costs less the only difference between this and the voyage is that its much lighter its brighter leds and a longer battery life if youre using the cover ive noticed the battery life drains much faster without the cover but youll still be able to read for hours without it you would think it be water resistant hence the name but it isnt but then i dont plan on reading when its raining or outside or while taking a bath overall its the best ereader amazon currently has to offer but if you dont mind the price tag and want the best then go for it voyage is still not a bad option though,"['great', 'ereader', 'little', 'pricy', 'spec', 'voyage', 'far', 'pixel', 'procesor', 'cost', 'less', 'difference', 'voyage', 'much', 'light', 'brighter', 'led', 'longer', 'battery', 'life', 'youre', 'use', 'cover', 'ive', 'notice', 'battery', 'life', 'drain', 'much', 'faster', 'without', 'cover', 'youll', 'still', 'able', 'read', 'hour', 'without', 'would', 'think', 'water', 'resistant', 'hence', 'name', 'isnt', 'dont', 'plan', 'read', 'rain', 'outside', 'take', 'bath', 'overall', 'best', 'ereader', 'amazon', 'currently', 'offer', 'dont', 'mind', 'price', 'tag', 'want', 'best', 'go', 'voyage', 'still', 'bad', 'option', 'though']",Positive
i have had every kindle since the first and this is by far the best the screen was already great on the voyage but the front light on this screen is more white and more evenly distributed physical page turn buttons are so much better than none or the haptic feedback type they didnt include the automatically adaptive front light for some reason but i dont think ill miss it much as i was always wont to fiddle with it on the voyage anywaybut this device made me smile as soon as i held it for the first time because it has a larger bezel that you can really grip comfortably without touching the screen maybe this isnt a big deal for most but that is exactly why i spent the money to get this devicethe other thing i was hoping for was the ability to use the upper page turn button to go forward and this device does that and even better because it is software configurablethe cover is very small and light and doesnt add much bulk like the voyage origami case does the only downside is that it doesnt work as a hands free stand for readingi still wish it was waterproof,"['every', 'kindle', 'since', 'first', 'far', 'best', 'screen', 'already', 'great', 'voyage', 'front', 'light', 'screen', 'white', 'evenly', 'distributed', 'physical', 'page', 'turn', 'button', 'much', 'good', 'none', 'haptic', 'feedback', 'type', 'didnt', 'include', 'automatically', 'adaptive', 'front', 'light', 'reason', 'dont', 'think', 'ill', 'miss', 'much', 'always', 'wont', 'fiddle', 'voyage', 'anywaybut', 'device', 'make', 'smile', 'soon', 'hold', 'first', 'time', 'large', 'bezel', 'really', 'grip', 'comfortably', 'without', 'touch', 'screen', 'maybe', 'isnt', 'big', 'deal', 'exactly', 'spend', 'money', 'get', 'devicethe', 'thing', 'hop', 'ability', 'use', 'upper', 'page', 'turn', 'button', 'go', 'forward', 'device', 'even', 'well', 'software', 'configurablethe', 'cover', 'small', 'light', 'doesnt', 'add', 'much', 'bulk', 'like', 'voyage', 'origami', 'case', 'downside', 'doesnt', 'work', 'hand', 'free', 'stand', 'readingi', 'still', 'wish', 'waterproof']",Positive

despite not being able to get one of these from amazon until late june due to apparent strong demand best buy was able to get one to me on the day of its release april  well done best buy having owned several previous kindles including the most recent paperwhite model i was unprepared for how small and light this new oasis model is  reading about it is one thing but actually holding one in your hand is something else entirely the oasis and its batterycharging cover together weigh only one ounce more than the latest paperwhite with no case the oasis without its cover feels impossibly light at  ounces sizewise the oasis is nearly a square shape at about  wide by  tall in fact the shape is so different from traditional kindle designs that i had to compare it next to my paperwhite to verify that the screens are actually the same size they are its the first kindle i think i could easily fit into a jacket pocket without any effort for frequent travelers like me this is a key reason to buy one of these as its extremely compact and easy to pack in a briefcase or purse the screen is the first frontlit kindle ive ever seen where you simply cannot see any trace of the leds from any angle no dark spots no bright spotsjust a completely uniform illumination from edge to edge in both directions the page also appears to be nearly flush with the top glass surface helping achieve the illusion of printed paper its sharp and clear better than any kindle ive used the reader can be easily separated from the battery case by simply pulling them apart since they are held together with magnets after doing so this is where the amazon engineering teams achievements really become clear as you just wont believe how lightweight this thing is its easy to imagine holding onto it for hours without any arm fatigue and switching from hand to hand is a simple matter of rotating it  degrees when switching the display instantly rotates and the page turn buttons also follow with the top button always used to advance the page and the bottom button always used to go backward you can also use the screen to change pages as you always have with earlier touch screen models the battery on the reader has a lower capacity than the covers battery so it runs down faster if you dont have it connected to the case its very easy to snap the reader back into its cover which allows it to recharge while you continue to read the power button and charge port are located in the upper topright corner more or less opposite from where they are on the paperwhite i find this location to be less awkward as its easier to reach on the top than it is on the bottom edge the back surface of the reader not the case seems to easily attract fingerprints and they are not so easy to clean off youd think that amazon would have figured out a way to prevent this by now its a minor annoyance lots of reviewers in the tech press have complained loudly about this models high price relative to other kindle models without ads its  vs  for an adless paperwhite is this a lot of money perhaps but if you are a book addict and value an extremely lightweight reader thats easy on both your arms and your eyes then i personally think its worth it a lot of thought and effort clearly went into designing and building this unit and the price reflects that is it for everyone probably not but there is obviously a market for it when you consider how many months youll have to wait to get one on amazons website if you are a serious reader this device deserves a very close look  im definitely keeping mine,"['despite',

even when i‚äôm outside in bright sunlight the words of the book i‚äôm reading are still crystal clear that alone makes the kindle oasis worth what it cost methe kindle oasis wakes up in just seconds and any book i choose instantly opens ready to be readit is the perfect size and isn‚äôt heavy or bulky i really do read for hours at a time sometimes i pace the floor while i read sometimes i‚äôm on my elliptical machine when i read and sometimes i‚äôm sitting down no matter what i‚äôm doing the kindle oasis remains comfortable to hold and it is always easy on my eyeswhen i receive a book that is in pdf most of the time i can enlarge the words if it won‚äôt allow me to enlarge the words i can change the orientation of the page and the words are automatically larger i am able to make notes on the book if needed and i can highlight words andor passagesmy merlot leather cover is attractive when i flip it open it is just like opening the cover of a bookhow to make the battery laston the kindle oasis page it says that its ‚äúdualbattery charging system delivers months of battery life‚äù this was a huge thing for me instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day i would be able to read for months without charging the kindleis this how my oasis has performed well not so much there are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your oasis to last for two monthsfirst you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day that one is impossible for me there are days that i am only able to read for thirty minutes but they don‚äôt occur very often my kindle goes everywhere with me and i use just about every spare moment to readsecond the wireless needs to be turned off that one is easy to do but not always easy to remember the only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more booksthird this is based on your light setting at  that is way too low for me i keep my light setting anywhere from  to  don‚äôt limit my reading to thirty minutes a day and i try to remember to keep my wireless turned off my light setting is kept anywhere from  to  and i put my kindle to sleep the second i‚äôm done reading so how long does a single charge last me ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far but it would have kept a charge for several more days if i had remembered to turn my wireless off once i succeed in keeping my wireless off i will let you know how long the charge lastsnow i don‚äôt plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low i allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover i allow it to drain down to about  before i plug the cover and kindle into my computer to chargethe one thing that surprised me was that everything on the oasis is in black and white for some reason i thought that maybe the book covers would appear in color but since i bought the oasis to read books on color isn‚äôt neededspecial offers do appear on my screen but only when my kindle is going to sleep or waking up they aren‚äôt a distraction and to be honest they are kind of fun to look at you can pay a higher price so they won‚äôt appear on your kindle if you would rather not see themi asked myself some questions once i had my kindle and knew just how it worked if i had known before i bought my kindle oasis that the charge wouldn‚äôt last for months would i still have bought it yes i would have if i had known that everything would appear in black and white would i still have bought it yes i would

ive had lots of tablets in the past mostly from the samsung line but this is my first amazon fire so i want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these at the time that this was written alexa had not been added to the tabletfirst while this device runs an android type of operating system amazon puts its own spin on the operating system i dont feel like im using android this feels different to me it doesnt have the same level of customization that android users have come to appreciate that being said if you are an amazon prime member this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine its simply a fun way to consume your magazines books etcthere are  onscreen buttons on the bottom of the device the middle button immediately takes you to your home screen the button to the left acts as a sort of back button it also lets me get rid of my keyboard when i dont need it on screen but its open the button to the right is super important it took me a couple of days to realize what it does that square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open it lets you switch between apps but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out you can close them by pressing the x button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right if you leave all of those apps open and you never close them youll drain your battery make sure you use that little square button to clear your appsthe device has several menus that you swipe left to view first you start with your home screen you literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet all of your apps are housed here you swipe up to view all of them the tablet comes with several apps preinstalled such as slik amazons own internet browser audible good reads the amazon app store a weather app etc you can go to the amazon app store to download other apps such as twitter facebook etc you can combine the apps on this page into folders you just drag one app to another app and a folder appears this made my home screen much more manageable you can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings this feature doesnt necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps however i believe it only changes the font on your main screensif you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device when you have a new issues it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of new items the device comes with a free  month subscription to the washington post youll see that under new items when you initially activate your tabletyou can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos you can do this through the settings menu on the device if you want to use one of your own photos however you need to either take it on the device or move it into amazons photos app which is a cloudbased appso far i havent found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper im not crazy about the amazon photo app i found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into amazons cloud just so i could view them on my tablet that being said im not planning to take photos on this device i just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaperbeyond the home screen you can swipe to the right to view your other screen they are prearranged to be books videos games shop apps music audiobooks and newstand all of those screens are connected to your amazon account for example if you have kindle books youve already purchased they automatically will appear under the books menu your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu there doesnt seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages that bugs me but its not the end of the world theres also one menu to the left of the home menu its the recent page it shows you what youve received looked at on the tablet i never use it but it might be handy for some peopleone of my favorite features of this tablet is amazons on deck capability if youre an amazon prime member amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like the items dont count against your preinstalled memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full you can turn off the on deck feature if you dont like it ive been content with the video playback capability this isnt my major use of the device but the images look fine and the audio is ok ill talk more about the speakers later my other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the newstand ive tried  magazines on here and they all look gorgeous now i can always have my magazines with me so if im stuck at the airport or at the doctors office i always have them one of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free i just had to connect my account to the device this allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as ive had an account my other magazine didnt include a digital edition so i canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version it was an inexpensive magazine anyway there are several magazines that you can try free for  days on the device i did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasurethe kindle fire doesnt come with the google play store installed you can side load it to the device without rooting it and breaking your warranty you can google to find the instructions to do this its not difficult to do if youre fairly comfortable with technology it probably took me  minutes most of the apps i wanted were in the amazon store but there were a handful that i had paid for through google play the only way i could have them was to go back to access that store they have worked fine so far i despise the keyboard that amazon preinstalled on this device there are no lines between the letters on the keyboard i suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys but i hate it i fixed that problem by going to google play and downloading a new keyboard it was a pretty easy problem to solve so i cant complainapps that are connecting to the internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets but that generally doesnt bother me if you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop however that might drive you crazy the screen on this device isnt bad if i compare it to my fancy phone its not as shape but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone the screen is outstandingthe speakers are ok there are two of them located on the bottom of the screen i wont say that they are fantastic they arent in my opinion they are fine for watching youtube or a television show they are not ok for listening to music if you are an audiophile you can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the preinstall app but still your music will sound tinny that being said you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker use a pair of headphones etcthis device wasnt made for taking pictures it has a front and back camera but they arent designed to be spectacular im not using themi find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands i think thats partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick also i do have some hand problems similar to someone who has carpal tunnel syndrome i think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives im still waiting for it im greatly enjoying this device its simply fun to use the tablet there are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck particularly if you regularly use amazon services if you dont typically use amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the internet and youre looking for a low price tag this device may be ok for you,"['ive', 'lot', 'tablet', 'past',
