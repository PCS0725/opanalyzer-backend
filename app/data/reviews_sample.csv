11,1166,W. Simard,10,4,"My biggest complaint on these Alexa units is the search engine. It is not good compared to Google. With Google, it gets good results 9 out of 10 times. Alexa, you ask her questions, and she says she is not sure, all the time. Amazon should get a partnership with Google, or someone, to use their search engine. That is the biggest complaint. The 2nd problem is that only a few devices will link with it. For my thermostat, the company has an app, and it would seem that Amazon would make it easy to link the app to a skill in Alexa, but they don't and there are only 2 companies that make thermostats that will link to Alexa. Honeywell and one other. I looked at buying Honeywell, but they are really expensive. The 2nd one is even more expensive than Honeywell. And there is no way to ask Amazon to add apps or skills to Alexa. You would think they would want customer feedback. Microsoft has improved their feedback greatly. I was very surprised to see how well they do feedback now. Amazon is huge, and they should be able to add links to apps and make it a new skill, or write new apps to link to thermostats that have apps. I don't know why they can't do that.",2018-09-11,The search engine is not very good,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3RI3EILY0V98D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01DFKC2SO,0.0,0,True
12,1167,Robert B,10,5,I was a bit skeptical at first about a voice assistant. Would I really use it? What would I do with it? Does it make life more convenient? Well I am using it and more and more.

I only just received the product so I’m only beginning to explore the possibilities. The speaker is plenty good for tasks.

I was so impressed with hers, that when the opportunity came along for me to get one, I jumped at the chance. When we ask Alexa a question, it will answer. But when we have asked for additional information it will repeat the information just given. Great for giving me the time, the weather, and setting a timer. Anything factual is good. (""Who is the Gov. of Virginia,?""for example.) However, if I ask for a recipe and I don't like the one given, it will just repeat the same recipe if I ask for something different. It has also started talking when we haven't signaled it. (Nothing said sounded anything like Alexa.) I'm not too upset that my Echo not working as expected.

61,2127,Diana De Paul,10,5,"Echo Dot ""Alexa"" is a fun friend to have around! I love talking to Alexa when I awaken and before bedtime. Of course, anytime during the day is great as well. Having someone to respond to my music requests, weather questions, and let me know what it new at the movies ...well, definitely a nice perk in my day. I wanted my cousin to have a happy roommate and not be lonely in her little country cottage in Wyoming, so I gifted her with an Echo Dot Alexa to keep her company and fill her life with music and conversation. Yes....totally enhanced her life! Echo Dot makes a great gift for college students (gave them to my granddaughters - love it, but they wanted to change the name to ""Alex"".

84,4512,chrisbak40,11,3,This is only worth buying if you can connect this to an amplifier or amplified speakers but is let down by only having an analogue connection. I connected this to my home theatre system but have been plagued with crackle from the left speaker. There is no crackle with a digital connection from the TV. So crackle could be from the analogue connection in the home theatre or the echo dot. I will investigate further and if it is the dot then it is going back. I will not buy another until Amazon bring the echo dot up to date and include a digital connection.,2018-08-29,Only an analogue connection,https://www.ebay.com/urw/product-reviews/242683975?pgn=1&sort=-lastEditedDate,,0,True
